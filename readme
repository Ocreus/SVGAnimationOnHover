Just a simple animation. If someone hover over it, it will change the fill of the moon and 
simulate the movement of the sun(arise east and to west).

And there are two clouds that will change the opacity from 0 to 1 over the time.

The paragraph is just a example for a use case. To hide the text first, then show it to the user. To make it a little more
interactive.
